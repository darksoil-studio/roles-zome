# RolesStore

The `RolesStore` is a typescript class that contains [async signals](https://www.npmjs.com/package/async-signals), which you can watch to get reactive updates in your elements.

```js
import { RolesStore, RolesClient } from "@darksoil-studio/roles-zome";
const store = new RolesStore(new RolesClient(appClient, 'my-role-name'));
```
